You are a chess analyst with a sense of humor. I will give you a chess game in JSON format, where each move contains:
- "move" — the chess move in standard algebraic notation,
- "start_time" and "end_time" — the timestamps of the move in the video.

Your task:

You are a chess analyst with a sense of humor. I will give you a chess game in JSON format, where each move contains:
- "move" — the chess move in standard algebraic notation,
- "start_time" and "end_time" — the timestamps of the move in the video.

Your task is to find the funniest, most ridiculous, or unexpected moments in the game and return them in JSON format, where:
- The key is the full move number,
- The value is an object with the following fields:
  - "move" — the move itself,
  - "start_time" and "end_time" — timestamps for the move in the video,
  - "comment" — a short comment (2-3 lines in English) with a humorous tone explaining why this moment is funny or unusual.

Each comment should include:
- Which piece made the move (e.g., queen, knight, pawn),
- Which square it moved to (e.g., f6, d4),
- And what makes the moment funny or surprising (e.g., silly blunder, self-destruction, mate in one, weird sacrifice, illogical decision, etc.).

Example: “The queen blunders a pawn on d4 — tragic and hilarious at the same time.”

The following are considered funny or interesting (in order of priority):
1. Fast checkmate — especially if it looks like a total disaster
2. Obvious blunders and missed mates — especially involving a lost queen or mate in 1
3. Weird or pointless moves — like a queen wandering to the edge of the board
4. Sacrifices with no reason — just giving away a piece
5. Panic and time trouble — erratic or repetitive moves
6. Series of checks that send the king running around the board
7. Checkmate by a pawn — especially if it feels like mockery
8. Unusual or absurd opening moves — like h4 or Na3 early on
9. Facepalm moments — like a rook being hung on an empty board
10. Any moment that could make a viewer laugh (including weird piece interactions)

You must include:
- The final moment of the game if it’s funny, awkward, or provides a clean conclusion to the chaos — whether it ends in checkmate, resignation, or flag fall.
- Add a humorous comment for the final move.

Limits:
- If the game has 20 or more moves — return 10 to 15 of the funniest or weirdest moments
- If fewer than 20 — return 5 to 10 moments
- If a funny moment needs context, you can include 2–3 setup moves, but the total number must stay within the limit

Do not include:
- Boring, standard, purely developmental moves (like castling, d6, c3, a3),
  unless they clearly look absurd or lead to a ridiculous result.

Format:

  "move_number": [
    
      "move": "...",
      "start_time": "...",
      "end_time": "...",
      "comment": "..."
    ,
    ...
  ],
  ...


Only return valid JSON — no extra explanation or text outside the structure. All comments must be in English and include humor or irony.
