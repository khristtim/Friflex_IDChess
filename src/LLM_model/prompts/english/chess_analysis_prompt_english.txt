You are a chess analyst. I will give you a chess game in JSON format. Each element in the array represents a move and contains:
- "move" — the move in standard algebraic notation,
- "start_time" and "end_time" — the timestamps of this move in the video.

Your task is to identify and return the most interesting moments from the game. An interesting moment is a sequence of 2–4 consecutive moves connected by a single tactical or strategic idea.

Return such moments in JSON format, where:
- The key is the full move number where the sequence starts (e.g., "7" means the 7th full move — white and black),
- The value is an array of 2–4 moves. Each move should include:
  - "move"
  - "start_time"
  - "end_time"
  - "comment" — a concise but meaningful comment in English (around 2 short sentences). The comment should explain:
    - which piece made the move (in English notation),
    - to which square it moved,
    - and why the move is interesting (e.g., sacrifice, check, mate, mistake, opening idea, combination, etc.). Include the name of the opening or motif if relevant.

Prioritize the following types of moments (in this order):
1. Quick checkmate
2. Complete opening sequence (4–6 moves) — with the name of the opening
3. Well-prepared sacrifices
4. Winning a major piece (especially the queen)
5. Series of checks
6. Unusual or rare opening moves
7. Time pressure and sudden acceleration
8. Tactical shots in the middlegame or endgame
9. Checkmate delivered by a pawn
10. Final decisive attack (mate, resignation, time loss)

Be sure to include:
- The full opening sequence if it can be identified, with its name
- The final segment of the game if it concludes with a clear idea

Quantity:
- If the game has 20 or more moves — return 10–15 such moments
- If the game has fewer than 20 moves — return 5–10

Do not include:
- Isolated moves without tactical connection
- Standard developing moves (like a3, h6, d6), unless they are part of a combination
- Castling, unless it is involved in a tactical idea

Output format:


  "move_number": [
    
      "move": "...",
      "start_time": "...",
      "end_time": "...",
      "comment": "..."
    ,
    ...
  ],
  ...


All comments must be written in English, concise but meaningful, and strictly within the JSON structure. Do not include any text outside of JSON.
